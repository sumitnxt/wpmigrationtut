            not only occupies 100% of width of the screen
            ( which any inline element does )but also occupies 100% height
            of the screen , which i don't know any other element except
            table can do just by using height = 100% . e.g if you try
            to give height in pixels the height of div element would
            increase but if you give height in percentage it would not
            accept it. Thus table element is the only element i know
            which can cover 100 percent height of the screen. Also Note
            that you cannot know the height of different screens
            vary so pixels won't work anyways.*/

            If you have started wordpress development for your site then right at the beginning its important to know that , " do not touch the customizing url settings" .  it may trouble you
            if you do , during wordpress migration. Once you have finished the site. the last thing can be tweak the url settings. And even then realize that you may have to migrate the site in future.

            If you have already tweaked url settings. Your best effort would be to set it back to default , although it may still give trouble.
